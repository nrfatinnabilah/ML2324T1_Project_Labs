## ML2324T1_Project_Labs

This project is the final project for class ML2324T1. This project focuses on the predictions for diabetes patients and the causes that lead to their diagnosis.

## Final Machine Learning Project

## Overview

This project includes four models to predict the occurence of diabetes and identify the causes of diagnosis in diabetes patients. The three models used are kNN, Linear regression and Logistic Regression. Additionally, in this project, we explore the dataset to determine the correlation for each variable in the dataset. The project is implemented in a Colab Notebook. The links below provide access ot the Colab Notebook and a Youtube video presentation where we explain each of the algorithms used to achieve the objectives of this project.
